//                       ===== DESCRIPTION =====
//
// One of the issues with applications that make use of semihosting operations
// (such as printf calls) is that the code will not execute correctly when the
// debugger is not connected. Generally this will show up with the application
// appearing to just hang. This may include the application running from reset
// or powering up the board (with the application already in FLASH), and also
// as the application failing to continue to execute after a debug session is
// terminated.
//
// The problem here is that the "bottom layer" of the semihosted variants of
// the C library, semihosting is implemented by a "BKPT 0xAB" instruction.
// When the debug tools are not connected, this instruction triggers a hard
// fault - and the default hard fault handler within an application will
// typically just contains an infinite loop - causing the application to
// appear to have hang when no debugger is connected.
//
// The below code provides an example hard fault handler which instead looks
// to see what the instruction that caused the hard fault was - and if it
// was a "BKPT 0xAB", then it instead returns back to the user application.
//
// In most cases this will allow applications containing semihosting
// operations to execute (to some degree) when the debugger is not connected.
//
// == NOTE ==
//
// Correct execution of the application containing semihosted operations
// which are vectored onto this hard fault handler cannot be guaranteed. This
// is because the handler may not return data or return codes that the higher
// level C library code or application code expects. This hard fault handler
// is meant as a development aid, and it is not recommended to leave
// semihosted code in a production build of your application!
//
// ****************************************************************************

// Allow handler to be removed by setting a define (via command line)
//#if !defined (__SEMIHOST_HARDFAULT_DISABLE)
//
//__attribute__((naked))
//void HardFault_Handler(void){
//    
//}
